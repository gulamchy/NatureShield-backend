# ðŸŒ¿ NatureSheild

---
Invasive species are spreading at an incredible rate. They are damaging ecosystems, agriculture, and biodiversity. Most people either do not recognize these invasive plants or don't know how to properly handle them. So, we created NatureShield, a mobile application that allows users to take or upload photos of a species and receive instant identification using AI, all on their smartphone.
